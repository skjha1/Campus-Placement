# :gift: Placement-Preparation :gift:
This repository is a complete guide to placement for technical interviews in tech companies where they will be asking you questions from the following Subjects, this placement ace is all about knowing any one particular programming language proficently, Rather then that you need to be very specific towards computer fundamentals.

* 📘 In college placement 1st round is of [***Aptitude***](https://github.com/skjha1/Placement/tree/main/01%20Aptitute)
* 📘 [***OOPS***](https://github.com/skjha1/Placement/tree/main/02%20OOPS) –  abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation.
* 📘 [***DBMS***](https://github.com/skjha1/Data-Science/tree/master/DBMS) – SQL queries, Normalization, transactions.      
* 📘 ***OS*** – process, threads, Process scheduling, deadlock, virtualization.      
* 📘 ***Networks*** – IP address, UDP, TCP
* 📘 ***C++ Programming*** (Any one programming language according to your preference).
* 📘 [***Data structures & algorithms***](https://github.com/skjha1/Data-Structure-Algorithm) The more proficient you are in data structure and algorithm, you will be a branded programmer. These concepts will help in software development phase, 
* 📘 ***Ability to write well structured and efficient code*** Ability to evaluate efficiency of the code at different levels – algo, DS, execution level (OS), hardware to reduce memory as well as time; understanding of different layers of the system, and ability to evaluate/assess the program at these different layers.


# 🏆 Programming Language
If you are getting started in the computer programming world, it is important for you to choose the right programming language that can help you land a job anytime you want so there is no doubt that programming plays a great role in our life in terms of computing tasks. After designing a software it is very important to implement it using any language i.e programming language is one of the most prominent part while implementaing any design with coding approach.
* It is ok to learn number of progamming language and implement it but, while coming to coding interviews we need to be very good at any one programming language.
* We can say that for technical interviews there is a prominent Importance of any one Programming language.

* ***Select a programming language you are confident while coding*** I will suggest you choosing one of these programming language for placement purpose (in order).
1. C++
2. C
3. Python
4. Java
### Some of the languages used at various organisations as reported online:

# 🏆 Aptitude

***Why Aptitude is Important?***

* It can get you eliminated, no matter how good you are at programming that is the only big and sufficient reason why you should be focusing on aptitude preparation during placements.
* It does not matter whether you solved all the programming questions in the first round or not if you made a mistake of not solving any aptitude and reasoning question, the chances of you being eliminated increases exponentially.


***Soft Skills***[Source](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-importance-of-the-aptitude-test-and-soft-skills-during-campus-recruitment-for-engineering-students#:~:text=If%20you%20are%20able%20to,any%20purpose%20during%20the%20placements.)

* Soft Skills are not only important during placements or interview but are also going to be an important part of your professional life.

* Soft skills are important because in an interview or in you professional life you will be encountering many such situations where your soft skills are going to decide the outcome of a situation.

 🔯 There are certain topics to be concerned for placement purpose, i.e  ***Quantitative Aptitude***, ***Verbal Ability***, ***Analytical and Logical Reasoning***, ***Data Interpretation and Data Sufficiency***.
 
✦ Under "Quantitative Aptitude" we have topics like 
 1) Number Systems
2) Percentage, Profit & Loss
3) Average, Mixtures and Allegations
4) Time and Work
5) Time and Distance
6) Equations‐Simple, Special and quadratic
7) Ratio, Proportion and Variations.
8) Inequalities
9) Geometry
10) Co‐ordinate geometry
11) Permutations and Combinations
12) Progressions and sequences

✺ Here all the important formula and defination for "Quantitative Aptitude" ([SOURCE](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1w3SEmf4GcgV-7cLn71TV2KG81VQkDQqW))

✺ These are some sets of "Quantitative Aptitude" problem with solution which is enough for cracking apti round, mostly you will be getting the same questions with some information changed.
