# :gift: Placement-Preparation :gift:
This repository is a complete guide to placement for technical interviews in tech companies where they will be asking you questions from the following Subjects, this placement ace is all about knowing any one particular programming language proficently, Rather then that you need to be very specific towards computer fundamentals.

* 📘 In college placement 1st round is of [***Aptitude***](https://github.com/skjha1/Placement/tree/main/01%20Aptitute)
* 📘 [***OOPS***](https://github.com/skjha1/Placement/tree/main/02%20OOPS) –  abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation.
* 📘 [***DBMS***](https://github.com/skjha1/Data-Science/tree/master/DBMS) – SQL queries, Normalization, transactions.      
* 📘 ***OS*** – process, threads, Process scheduling, deadlock, virtualization.      
* 📘 ***Networks*** – IP address, UDP, TCP
* 📘 ***C++ Programming*** (Any one programming language according to your preference).
* 📘 [***Data structures & algorithms***](https://github.com/skjha1/Data-Structure-Algorithm) The more proficient you are in data structure and algorithm, you will be a branded programmer. These concepts will help in software development phase, 
* 📘 ***Ability to write well structured and efficient code*** Ability to evaluate efficiency of the code at different levels – algo, DS, execution level (OS), hardware to reduce memory as well as time; understanding of different layers of the system, and ability to evaluate/assess the program at these different layers.


# 🏆 Programming Language
There is no doubt that programming plays a great role in our life in terms of computing tasks. After designing a software it is very important to implement it using any language i.e programming language is one of the most prominent part while implementaing any design with coding approach.
* It is ok to learn number of progamming language and implement it but, while coming to coding interviews we need to be very good at any one programming language.
* We can say that for technical interviews there is a prominent Importance of any one Programming language.
